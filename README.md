# FoxDash v1.1
2D Platformer Game developed from scratch in Unity, using free artwork & sound effects from the Unity Asset Store. This repository contains all the C# scripts applied to the various objects in the unity project.

#### v1.1:
- Added 'pause' option. Player can resume or quit from the pause menu. 

## Setup:
My dropbox: https://www.dropbox.com/home/GameDev/Completed%20Projects/FoxDash/Builds contains working builds of the game
that can be played on Windows or Mac computers. Download the .dmg file (Mac) or the installer (Windows).

## What I Learned:
- Created the gameObjects (player, enemies, collectibles, ladders, etc.) in Unity, wrote and added scripts to them. 
- Levels designed by creating tilemaps from level art and using Unity's built-in 'tile palette' to draw the levels.
- Wrote all the code in the game from scratch: player controller, enemy AI, collectibles, ladders, dying & restarting the game, keeping track of deaths/collectibles/enemies defeated, changing from level 1 to level 2, playing music, etc.
- Wrote & produced the music.
